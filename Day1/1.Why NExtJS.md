Key Features of Next.js — Interview Guide
Here's a structured breakdown of Next.js features, perfect for interviews:

1. 🗂️ File-Based Routing
Routes are automatically created based on the file structure inside the app/ (or pages/) directory
No need to configure a router manually
Supports nested routes, dynamic routes ([id]), and catch-all routes ([...slug])
2. 🖥️ Rendering Strategies
Next.js supports multiple rendering methods — this is a top interview topic:

Method	Description
SSR (Server-Side Rendering)	HTML generated on every request
SSG (Static Site Generation)	HTML generated at build time
ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)	Static page that re-generates in background after a given interval
CSR (Client-Side Rendering)	Rendering in the browser (like plain React)
In the App Router, components are React Server Components (RSC) by default, meaning they render on the server.

3. ⚡ React Server Components (RSC)
Components run on the server — no JS sent to the client
Can directly access databases, APIs, file systems
Use "use client" directive only when you need interactivity
4. 🔌 API Routes
Build backend endpoints directly inside your Next.js app
In App Router: create a route.ts file with GET, POST, etc. handlers
Eliminates the need for a separate backend for simple use cases
5. 🖼️ Image Optimization (next/image)
Automatic lazy loading, resizing, format conversion (WebP)
Prevents layout shift (CLS)
Serves correctly sized images per device
6. 🔤 Font Optimization (next/font)
Automatically self-hosts Google Fonts — no external network request
Eliminates layout shift caused by font loading
7. 🔗 Link Prefetching (next/link)
Links are automatically prefetched when they enter the viewport
Makes navigation feel instant
8. 📦 Code Splitting
Next.js automatically splits code by route
Users only download the JS they need for the current page
9. 🧭 App Router vs Pages Router
App Router (v13+)	Pages Router (legacy)
Default	Server Components	Client Components
Layouts	Nested layouts via layout.tsx	_app.tsx
Data Fetching	async/await in components	getServerSideProps, getStaticProps
10. 🔄 Streaming & Suspense
Pages can stream HTML progressively to the browser
Use <Suspense> to show loading skeletons while server data loads
Improves Time to First Byte (TTFB)
11. 🛡️ Middleware
Runs code before a request is completed (at the Edge)
Use cases: authentication, redirects, A/B testing, localization
12. 🌍 Built-in SEO Support
Easy <head> management using the Metadata API (metadata export or generateMetadata())
SSR/SSG ensures content is crawlable by search engines

🎯 Quick Interview Summary (1-liner)
"Next.js is a React framework that adds server-side rendering, static generation, file-based routing, API routes, and built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and scripts — making it production-ready out of the box."
