### ✅ Your Script
> *"I started my career [mention how — CS degree / passion project / internship]. From early on, I was drawn to the frontend because I love the intersection of design and logic that React brings.*
>
> *Over the years, I've progressively taken on more responsibility — starting with component development, then owning entire feature builds, then leading frontend architecture decisions. I've worked deeply with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and have been touching backend work more recently through Node.js and API integrations.*
>
> *What I'm most proud of is [mention a specific project or achievement]. It pushed me to level up not just technically but also in cross-team communication and delivering under pressure.*
>
> *Now, I'm at a stage where I want to own the full stack — not just the UI — and this role is the natural next step in that journey."*

## 5. "What Are Your Strengths?"

> ⚠️ Pick **3 strengths** that directly match the job description. Always back each with a **specific example**.

### 🗺️ Answer Roadmap
```
Strength → Proof → Impact
   │            │        │
   ▼            ▼        ▼
"I am..."  "For example..." "The result was..."
```

### ✅ Your 3 Strengths (Mapped to JD)

**Strength 1 — React/TypeScript Expertise (Core JD requirement)**
> *"My biggest strength is my deep expertise in React and TypeScript. I don't just write working code — I think about component design, performance, and maintainability. For example, I [describe a specific refactor or architecture decision] which [resulted in X outcome — e.g., '50% reduction in re-renders, improving page speed score from 60 to 95']."*

**Strength 2 — Cross-functional Communication (Mentioned in your resume)**
> *"I'm a strong communicator and collaborator. Working across design, backend, and product teams comes naturally to me. In [project name], I was the bridge between the UI team and backend engineers, which helped us cut our integration bugs by [X%] and ship 2 weeks ahead of schedule."*

**Strength 3 — Continuous Learning (Key for this role)**
> *"I'm a fast learner who genuinely enjoys picking up new tools. When AI/ML started becoming relevant in frontend, I proactively started learning about LLM API integration and GenAI. I've already built [mention any AI-related project or experiment] which gave me hands-on experience that I can bring to this team."*

---

## 6. "What Are Your Weaknesses?"

> ⚠️ Be **genuine** but smart. Show self-awareness + active improvement. Never say "I'm a perfectionist."

### ✅ Your Script
> *"One area I've been consciously working on is backend and DevOps depth. While I'm comfortable consuming REST APIs and deploying to platforms like Vercel or Netlify, I know I need more hands-on experience with Go, production-grade databases, and Kubernetes in real workloads.*
>
> *To address this, I've been [specific action — e.g., 'building a side project with a Go backend and PostgreSQL', 'doing the Docker/Kubernetes course on [platform]', 'contributing to backend PRs at my current job'].*
>
> *This role actually excites me because it will accelerate this growth in a real production environment."*

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ✅ Your Script (Fill in your project details)
> *"One of my most challenging projects was [project name]. The situation was [describe business context — e.g., 'We had to migrate a legacy jQuery app to React in 6 weeks while the product was still live for users'].*
>
> *My task was to [your specific responsibility — e.g., 'architect the React component structure and ensure zero downtime during migration'].*
>
> *I took a phased approach — I [describe your specific actions: e.g., 'created a micro-frontend setup', 'wrote thorough unit tests', 'coordinated with the QA team on regression testing', 'set up feature flags'].*
>
> *The result was [quantified outcome — e.g., 'we completed the migration in 5 weeks with zero critical bugs in production and a 40% improvement in page load speed']."*

---

## 8. "How Do You Handle Conflicts in a Team?"

### ✅ Your Script
> *"I believe most technical conflicts come from different people having different information or priorities, not from bad intentions.*
>
> *When conflicts arise, I first try to understand the other person's perspective — I ask questions before I push my view. For example, [describe a real situation — e.g., 'There was a disagreement with a backend engineer about API response structure. Instead of insisting on my format, I scheduled a 30-minute call where we mapped both frontend and backend needs, and we landed on a solution that worked for both sides']*
>
> *If it's a purely technical disagreement, I prefer to make the case with data — performance metrics, user impact, or industry standards. If we still can't agree, I'm comfortable deferring to the team lead while documenting my concerns."*

---

## 9. "Tell Me About a Time You Missed a Deadline"

> ⚠️ Every interviewer knows engineers miss deadlines sometimes. They want to see **ownership + recovery**.

### ✅ Your Script
> *"There was a sprint where I underestimated the complexity of integrating a third-party authentication library with our custom session management. The task was planned for 3 days but took 5.*
>
> *As soon as I realized I was falling behind on day 2, I immediately flagged it to my team lead — I didn't wait until the last day. We together decided to [e.g., 'descope a non-critical feature from the sprint and push the auth work to completion'].*
>
> *After the sprint, I did a personal retrospective and added better estimation buffers for third-party integrations going forward. That experience taught me to raise blockers early — even if it feels uncomfortable — because the team always appreciates transparency over surprises."*

---

## 10. "Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?"

### ✅ Your Script
> *"In 5 years, I see myself as a senior or lead full-stack engineer — someone who doesn't just write great code, but also mentors junior developers, drives architectural decisions, and bridges the gap between technical and product teams.*
>
> *More specifically, I want to become truly full-stack — where I'm as comfortable designing a database schema or a Go microservice as I am building a React component. I also want to deepen my expertise in AI/ML integration, as I believe that will be a critical skill for software engineers going forward.*
>
> *This role at [Company] is a direct step towards that vision — it gives me the breadth across React, Go, databases, and DevOps that I need to grow into that full-stack senior role."*

---

## 11. "What Is Your Expected Salary?"

> ⚠️ Never give a number first if possible. Research market rates beforehand.

│  IF PUSHED FOR A NUMBER:                                    │
│  State a range, not a single number.                        │
│  Start with 15-20% above your minimum.                      │
│  "Based on my [X] years of experience and                   │
│   market research, I'm targeting [₹X - ₹Y LPA].            │
│   But I'm open to the full compensation picture."           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ✅ Your Script
> *"I've researched the market for senior full-stack roles with React/TypeScript at this level, and based on that and my experience, I'm targeting [your range]. That said, I'm also interested in the full package — learning opportunities, growth path, and work culture matter equally to me. Could you share the budgeted range for this role?"*

---

## 12. "Are You Comfortable Working in a Cross-Functional Team?"

> ✅ Your resume already mentions cross-functional teams — use this to your advantage.

### ✅ Your Script
> *"Absolutely — in fact, cross-functional collaboration is one of my strengths. I've consistently worked at the intersection of design, product, backend, and QA teams.*
>
> *What I've found is that the best products are built when engineers understand the 'why' behind features, not just the 'what'. So I actively participate in product discussions, ask UX designers about user flows, and have regular syncs with backend engineers.*
>
> *For example, [mention a specific cross-team experience — e.g., 'I worked with the design team to define a design system from scratch, which reduced inconsistency in the UI and sped up our component development by 3x']."*

---

## 13. "How Do You Stay Updated With New Technologies?"

> ✅ Your resume mentions AI/ML and GenAI — show this proactively.

### ✅ Your Script
> *"Staying current is something I genuinely enjoy — not just because it's required, but because I find it exciting.*
>
> *My regular habits include: following engineering blogs from companies like Vercel, the React core team's RFCs, and newsletters like JavaScript Weekly and TLDR Tech. I also follow key thought leaders on LinkedIn and X (Twitter) for real-time industry discussions.*
>
> *Beyond reading, I learn by building. When Next.js App Router launched, I immediately started a side project to understand the full implications of React Server Components. When LLMs became widely available via APIs, I built a RAG-based chatbot to understand the stack hands-on.*
>
> *Most recently, I've been exploring [mention something current — e.g., AI agents, LangChain, or a specific framework from the JD]."*

---

## 14. "What Motivates You?"

### ✅ Your Script
> *"I'm most motivated when I can see the impact of my work — when code I write genuinely improves someone's experience or makes a product faster, more reliable, or more delightful to use.*
>
> *I also get a lot of energy from solving complex technical problems — especially the kind where there's no obvious 'right answer' and you have to make informed trade-offs. The research, the discussion with the team, the decision — that process is something I find deeply engaging.*
>
> *Finally, I'm motivated by growth environments — teams and companies where I'm always learning something new. That's a big part of why this role appeals to me."*

---

## 15. "Do You Have Any Questions for Us?"

> ⚠️ **ALWAYS have questions ready.** Not asking questions signals disinterest.

### ✅ Best Questions to Ask the HR/Hiring Manager

**About the Team:**
- *"What does the day-to-day look like for this role — how do senior engineers split their time between feature work, code reviews, and technical design?"*
